# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Canvas

Utilizing ctx from canvas, I created, drew, and updated 2d  models on the DOM with randomized paths creating a live background similar to classic screen savers. With this in mind, I also added numerous booliean varibles tied to drawing and pathes and connected them to an easy to use user interface to allow customizatuion fo the live background rendering.
Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write something. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

# Lessons Learned:
Through this project I was able to learn a lot regarding the intricacies of canvas's ctx and advanced use of RGBA . Exspecially through the building of the customize system, I was able to really dive into the nitty gritty and learn what each little bit controlled and how to utilize that to a desired effect.
